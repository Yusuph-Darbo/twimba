## 🖼️ Overview

**Twimba** is a front-end project inspired by Twitter’s feed design.
Users can view, like, and reply to posts in a dynamic feed built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.
Each post includes a username, avatar, text content, like/reply counts, and responsive button interactions.

The focus of this project was to recreate a realistic social feed layout and practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and clean UI structure using pure front-end technologies.
